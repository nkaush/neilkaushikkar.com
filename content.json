        "I am an instructor for the Disruption Lab at Gies' Incubator Program. This program aims to prepare students for careers in product management and tech consulting by teaching core technical skills and helping students discover how business and technology intersect. I am developing a curriculum to teach students in non-technical majors about the basics of Python, Bash, web development, and more. I hold weekly lectures for 16 students in the CS track of the Incubator program."

Based on initial testing, this application saved over 200 hours/week of manual customer validation. I developed a REST API with Java-based Azure Functions App and a PostgreSQL database to securely stream audio between cloud and on-premise systems and cross-check callers' spoken identifying information."

I constructed a data pipeline to consolidate and structure data from JHU, the Opensky Network, FAA, BTS, and NASA's Sherlock Data Warehouse. I also implemented random forest machine learning algorithms to model air traffic in the US and predict air traffic patterns in the future."
